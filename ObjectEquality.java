/**
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* When writing object-oriented programs (i.e. Java), the need is almost always
* there to compare instances of the same class. And once instances are
* "comparable", they can then be sorted.
*
* The key to this example is that you should always use the equals() method
* when comparing objects. The relational operator == tests for pointer equality
* (i.e., do the objects point to the same thing). The equals method tests to
* see whether the two objects are equal (and may vary in definition from one
* object to the next). It is up to the developer to decide what makes two
* objects "equal".
*
* Every class by default has a method called equals() which has the following
* signature:
*
* public boolean equals(Object obj)
*
* This method accepts an object as its argument, performs a comparison and
* returns true if the two object instances are equal and false otherwise.
* What some developers fail to realize is that the equals() method, in its
* default state, only compares the memory addresses of two objects, not their
* contents. (This is the behavior of what we see when using the relational
* operator == to compare two objects.) To compare the contents of two objects
* you must override the equals method.
*
* For most of the Java library classes, the equals() method is already
* overridden for you. (i.e. Integer)
*
* Note that both the equals() and hostCode() methods are used by hashes
* (Hashtable and HashMap).
*
* Here are the rules for an equals() method:
* 1.) It if reflexive : x.equals(x) must be true.
* 2.) It is symmetric : x.equals(y) must be true if and only if
* y.equals(x) is also true.
* 3.) It is transitive : if x.equals(y) is true
* and y.equals(z) is true;
* then x.equals(z) must also be true.
* 4.) It it consistent : Multiple calls on x.equals(y) return the
* same value (unless state values used in the
* comparison are changed, as by calling a set
* method).
* 5.) It is cautious : x.equals(null) must return false,
* rather than accidentally throwing a
* NullPointerException.
*
* NOTE: Even with the testing that has been provided in the "Employee"
* class, what could go wrong? Well, there are situations that still
* need care. What if the object is a subclass of Employee? We cast
* it and .... compare only our fields. Like in our example, you
* should test explicitly with getClass() if subclassing is likely.
* And subclasses should call super.equals() to test all superclass
* fields.
*
* Other things that can go wrong; what if either emp1, emp2, etc
* is null? In cases like this, you would be handed a
* NullPointerException. So you also need to test for any possible
* null values.

* Relational operators generate a boolean result. They evaluate the
* relationship between the values of the operands. A relational expression
* produces a "true" if the relationship is true, and "false" if the
* relationship is untrue. The relational operators are:
*
* < - less than
* > - greater than
* <= - less than or equal to
* >= - greater than or equal to
* == - equivalent
* != - not equivalent
*
* Equivalence and nonequivalence works with all built-in types,
* but the other
* comparisons won't work with the type "boolean".
*
* The relational operators "==" and "!=" also work with all objects, but
* their meaning often confuses new comers to Java.
